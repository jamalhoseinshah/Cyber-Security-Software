## OpenAudit Software Installation Guidance 
 
### What is open-audit and how does it work?

Open-AudIT is an application to tell you exactly what is on your network, how it is configured and when it changes. Most organizations cannot give accurate location data of their assets, Open-AudIT gives you this information in seconds. Open-AudIT intelligently scans an organizationâ€™s network and stores the configurations of the discovered devices.
 
### How does open-audit work?

The script gathers extensive information and sends it back to the Open-AudIT server. If the device is a switch, router, printer, etc and it has SNMP enabled and Open-AudIT has working credentials, its attributes will be queried using SNMP and no audit scripts will be used. Once the data is in Open-AudIT, it is yours to query at will.
 
### Compatibility

Windows download is not compatible with Windows 10.
* Opmantek uses and recommends Windows Server 2016. 
* All downloads are for 64bit systems only.
* Most suitable installation in Cento , Ubuntu and window server 2016 is recommended. Other than these mentioned operating systems it is very difficult to handle installation.
